#explanation:- Sure! Let's go step by step and explain this program in **simple English**, and also why `i = 0` is used.zzzzz

### ‚úÖ What the program does:

This program checks **if a number (`x = 56`) is present in a list (`nums`)**.
If the number is found, it prints **the index (position)** where it was found.

---

### üß† Line-by-line Explanation:

```python
nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7)
```

This creates a **tuple** called `nums` that holds several numbers.

```python
x = 56
```

This is the number we're **trying to find** in the list.

```python
i = 0
```

We set `i = 0` because we want to keep track of the **index (position)** of each number in the list.
The **first number** is at **index 0**, the second at index 1, and so on.

```python
for val in nums:
```

This means: **Go through each number** (`val`) in the list one by one.

```python
    if val == x:
```

This checks: **Is the current number equal to `x` (56)?**

```python
        print("found at idx ", i)
```

If yes, print the message and show the current index `i`.

```python
    i += 1
```

This means: **Increase `i` by 1**, so the next index is correct.

---

### ‚ùì Why `i = 0` is necessary:

Python‚Äôs `for` loop over a list (or tuple) **doesn‚Äôt automatically give the index**.
So if we want to know **at what position** we found the number, we need to **keep count manually** using `i`.

`i = 0` starts the count at the beginning, and `i += 1` moves the count forward as we go through the list.

---

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Final Note:

In this program, `x = 56` is **not in the list**, so it will not print anything.

---

### ‚úÖ If you change it to:

```python
x = 3
```

Then output will be:

```
found at idx  2
found at idx  6
```

Because 3 appears at index 2 and 6 in the list.
